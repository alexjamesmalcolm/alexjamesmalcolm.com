What is communication? Talking face to face, texting, and calls all are obviously communication. When I'm listening to a [YouTube](YouTube.md) video about programming, science, or game of thrones, that is also a kind of communication. It's a one directional communication. It travels from the creator to the viewers. In the same manner, though less common for myself, books are a similar means of communication. We each have 24 hours in a day but through the use of books it is possible for 2 people in a society to communicate with each other over vast distances, durations, or both.
