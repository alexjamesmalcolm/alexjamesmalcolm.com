>6 All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God’s name and our teaching may not be slandered. 2 Those who have believing masters should not show them disrespect just because they are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve them even better because their masters are dear to them as fellow believers and are devoted to the welfare of their slaves.

Structure: Christians who are slaves of non Christian masters should fully respect their masters so that they will in turn respect the name of Christ. Christians who are slaves of Christian masters should respect them even more because they are believers and because the Christian masters are expected to hold the welfare of slaves as a high priority.

Literary/theological context: The paragraph before is about how our sins and good deeds are sometimes revealed quickly and sometimes revealed much later, but are always revealed. The point is that some people are more evil than we realize and some are more righteous than we realize.

The paragraph after this is a warning about false teachers.

Main Point: All Christians, whether the slave or master, are called to devoted love of each other because we are all God's children. The world would have masters as tyrants and slaves as fearful but to instead act in love is a testament to Christ.


### False Teachers and the Love of Money

>These are the things you are to teach and insist on. 3 If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, 4 they are conceited and understand nothing. They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions 5 and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.

###### Structure
Teach sound doctrine as has been laid out in this letter. You can recognize false teachers if they teach otherwise. False teachers are fools who understand nothing but think they are right. They take an unhealthy interest in biblically tangential topics. The Gospel has an answer to the problem of our heart but the false teachers will argue over anything to avoid the humility that comes from dwelling on the Gospel. They will read [Romans 8](Romans%208.md) and argue over predestination rather than a life lived in the Spirit.

###### Literary/theological context
The paragraph before was concerned about how Christian slaves treat their masters, and how Christian masters treat their slaves. Each are done because all life deserves respect and so that the Gospel will reach both non-Christian masters and slaves.

The paragraph after this one is about the dangers of a love of money. That those who love money pierce themselves with many griefs. But the one who is godly and content instead has great gain.

###### Main Point
False teachers are evil accusers that are motivated by financial gain. Their words are filled with every kind of evil. They distract from true godliness with their speech.

>Paul began his letter by addressing the false teachers, and here, he ends his letter in the same way. So far, Paul identifies false teachers by both their _doctrine_ and their _deeds_. These false teachers didn’t have **“love”** as their end goal (1 Tim. 1:5). Instead, their teaching led to ripping apart people’s spiritual lives, including their own (1 Tim. 1:20; 1 Tim. 4:1-2).
>[1 Timothy 6:3-21 (The Hidden Costs of Materialism)](https://www.evidenceunseen.com/bible-difficulties-2/nt-difficulties/1-2-timothy-titus-philemon-hebrews-james-1-2-peter/introduction-to-1-2-timothy/#_Toc129947451)



What are the things which Timothy is to teach and insist on? This question is important because it decides how we interpret the beginning of verse 3.

What is the scope of the "these are the things," is it specifically about slaves, the preceding paragraph? The previous chapters teaching on widows and elders? Is it the entire letter? Or is it any teaching of proper doctrine?

The teachings on slaves, widows, and elders could fit with verse 5 since Paul tells us that these false teachers are motivated by financial gain. If that's the case we could expect them to twist teachings on property and church financial support. Slaves were property and Paul had just taught on financially supporting widows and elders by certain criteria.

I think that he meant the entire letter, this is his concluding chapter.

That "these... things" refers to any proper doctrine would be an acceptable use of this verse, even according to Paul, but I do not think that is what Paul specifically meant when he wrote this.


"constant friction between people of corrupt mind"
We could imagine that the friction is caused by a conflict over money but we could also just as easily imagine that the conflict is over



>6 But godliness with contentment is great gain. 7 For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. 8 But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. 9 Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. 10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.

##### Structure
Living content with what we have rather than wishing for more is to live more inline with true reality (rather than the lies of the world system). We entered this world without any possessions and we will leave it in the same way. The only thing that we can take with us are the relationships that we build.

### Final Charge to Timothy

>11 But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness. 12 Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 13 In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you 14 to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 16 who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen.

>17 Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. 18 Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. 19 In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.

>20 Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge, 21 which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith.

>Grace be with you all.
