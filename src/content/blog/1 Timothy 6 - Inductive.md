>6 All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God’s name and our teaching may not be slandered. 2 Those who have believing masters should not show them disrespect just because they are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve them even better because their masters are dear to them as fellow believers and are devoted to the welfare of their slaves.

##### Structure
Christians who are slaves of non Christian masters should fully respect their masters so that they will in turn respect the name of Christ. Christians who are slaves of Christian masters should respect them even more because they are believers and because the Christian masters are expected to hold the welfare of slaves as a high priority.

##### Literary/theological context
The paragraph before is about how our sins and good deeds are sometimes revealed quickly and sometimes revealed much later, but are always revealed. The point is that some people are more evil than we realize and some are more righteous than we realize.

The paragraph after this is a warning about false teachers.

##### Main Point
All Christians, whether the slave or master, are called to devoted love of each other because we are all God's children. The world would have masters as tyrants and slaves as fearful but to instead act in love is a testament to Christ.


### False Teachers and the Love of Money
#### 1 Timothy 6:2-5

>These are the things you are to teach and insist on. 3 If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, 4 they are conceited and understand nothing. They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions 5 and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.

###### Structure
Teach sound doctrine as has been laid out in this letter. You can recognize false teachers if they teach otherwise. False teachers are fools who understand nothing but think they are right. They take an unhealthy interest in biblically tangential topics. The Gospel has an answer to the problem of our heart but the false teachers will argue over anything to avoid the humility that comes from dwelling on the Gospel. They will read [Romans 8](Romans%208.md) and argue over predestination rather than a life lived in the Spirit.

###### Literary/theological context
The paragraph before was concerned about how Christian slaves treat their masters, and how Christian masters treat their slaves. Each are done because all life deserves respect and so that the Gospel will reach both non-Christian masters and slaves.

The paragraph after this one is about the dangers of a love of money. That those who love money pierce themselves with many griefs. But the one who is godly and content instead has great gain.

###### Main Point
False teachers are evil accusers that are motivated by financial gain. Their words are filled with every kind of evil. They distract from true godliness with their speech.

>Paul began his letter by addressing the false teachers, and here, he ends his letter in the same way. So far, Paul identifies false teachers by both their _doctrine_ and their _deeds_. These false teachers didn’t have **“love”** as their end goal (1 Tim. 1:5). Instead, their teaching led to ripping apart people’s spiritual lives, including their own (1 Tim. 1:20; 1 Tim. 4:1-2).
>[1 Timothy 6:3-21 (The Hidden Costs of Materialism)](https://www.evidenceunseen.com/bible-difficulties-2/nt-difficulties/1-2-timothy-titus-philemon-hebrews-james-1-2-peter/introduction-to-1-2-timothy/#_Toc129947451)


##### What are the things which Timothy is to teach and insist on?
What are the things which Timothy is to teach and insist on? This question is important because it decides how we interpret the beginning of verse 3.

What is the scope of the "these are the things," is it specifically about slaves, the preceding paragraph? The previous chapters teaching on widows and elders? Is it the entire letter? Or is it any teaching of proper doctrine?

The teachings on slaves, widows, and elders could fit with verse 5 since Paul tells us that these false teachers are motivated by financial gain. If that's the case we could expect them to twist teachings on property and church financial support. Slaves were property and Paul had just taught on financially supporting widows and elders by certain criteria.

I think that he meant the entire letter, this is his concluding chapter.

That "these... things" refers to any proper doctrine would be an acceptable use of this verse, even according to Paul, but I do not think that is what Paul specifically meant when he wrote this.


"constant friction between people of corrupt mind"
We could imagine that the friction is caused by a conflict over money but we could also just as easily imagine that the conflict is over


#### 1 Timothy 6:6-10
>6 But godliness with contentment is great gain. 7 For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. 8 But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. 9 Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. 10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.

##### Structure
The only thing that we can take with us into the next life are our relationships that we form here. This is the reality of the world that the lies of the world system obscure. There are no other possessions which we cane take with us into the next life. To live content with our basic needs met and in pursuit of relationships is of the greatest gain only behind personally knowing Christ.

If we ignore this teaching and instead act on the lies of the world system we will be led to ruin and destruction. "The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."

##### Literary/theological context
The previous paragraph is about how evil false teachers and their words are. The next paragraph is an exhortation to Timothy to flee from false teaching and love of money.

##### Main Point
The love of money is a lie of the world system that money will bring us joy when it really will only bring us ruin. Contentment with what we have and pursuit of God is great gain.

The love of money is a lie of the world system that money will bring us joy but placing our hope in money will only bring us ruin. Contentment with what we have and pursuit of God is great gain.


What are ways that we can hold onto contentment while we're entering into this new phase of life?
- Gratitude
- In college we were all the same but now we are at risk of comparing ourselves to others
- Reminding ourselves that if we surround ourselves with stuff 
- Hope in wealth is an uncertain foundation but giving our wealth for God is to make a strong foundation


### Final Charge to Timothy
#### 1 Timothy 6:11-16
>11 But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness. 12 Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 13 In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you 14 to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 16 who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen.

God is worthy of us putting our hope in him rather than money.
##### Structure
We are called to flee from materialism and instead pursue every kind of godliness. It is not enough to just flee. The beliefs in our heart must be challenged. By sharing God's values it will be harder for materialism to take a hold in our hearts.

Paul calls us to fight the good fight of faith, which is a metaphor for either running, boxing, or wrestling. 

What is this good confession that Timothy made in the presence of many witnesses?

>Mounce and Earle understands this to be Timothy’s baptism (1 Tim. 1:18; 4:14). Perhaps. In our view, however, the context favors evangelism. In the very next verse, Paul refers to Jesus’ “good confession” in front of Pontius Pilate. So, evangelism seems to be in view.

I'm not sure who I am disagreeing with but as this quote, as it is written from Evidence Unseen, does not make sense to me. 1 Timothy 1:18; 4:14 are not about Timothy's baptism but Timothy being raised up as a leader and possibly being sent off to the [Church in Ephesus](Church%20in%20Ephesus.md). After thinking about it for a while I am left to agree that this good confession is likely related to evangelism but it's not totally clear what exactly.

Paul connects the "good confession" that Timothy had once made with the "good confession" that [Jesus](Lord.md) made before [Pontius Pilate](Pontius%20Pilate.md). Before God, Paul charges Timothy to fight the good fight of faith until the return of Jesus.

Paul praises God as the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, Lord of lords, who alone is immortal? Do we not also have immortal souls? In what sense is God the only immortal?
This is the blue letter bible word for immortal: https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g110/nlt/mgnt/0-1/

God lives in unapproachable light and no one has ever seen him. This reminds me of [Exodus 33:18-23](Exodus%2033.md) where God passes by [Moses](Moses.md) but he is not able to see God directly.


>17 Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. 18 Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. 19 In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.

>20 Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge, 21 which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith.

>Grace be with you all.
